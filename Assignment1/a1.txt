CMPUT 331 a1p4

The original ceaser cipher has 25 distinct keys
For a1p1, there are 51 distinct keys
For a1p2, there are 51 distinct keys
For a1p3, there are 51^n, keys, where n is the length of the keyword. provided
that the keyword is not longer than the message. If the length of the keyword is
longer than the length of the message, then there are 51^m keys, where m is the length
of the message

If only accounting for number of distinct keys, part 2 is more secure than the
original ceaser cipher. The pattern in part two is harder to decrypt than
the original, which would make it more secure, due to the changing key

Another way an attacker could decipher the message is by analyzing the letter frequency in the message
and compare it to the standard letter frequency for the English language.
ie. e is the most frequently used letter in the English language, so it would be
reasonable to assume the most frequent letter in the enciphered message is actually an e

This weakness would be easiest to exploit for a1p1. It would be more difficult to determine
for a1p2 and a1p3. With an ever changing key in part 2, frequency analysis becomes more difficult,
With a pattern of keys in part 3, and would be more difficult than in part 1.
